# My Hangar README

## Basic rails CRUD app to add airplanes to a hangar.

Classic rails project. Run bundle install and yarn install

rails db:create db:migrate db:seed -> You should have a garage with 3 airplanes inside.

OBJECTIVES:

Implement Update and Destroy functionality to the Airplanes Controller. Remember:

Routes -> Controller -> View

Yould write the correct routes, create the controller using 'DRY' principles (remember before_action ?) and setup a cool reusable view.
